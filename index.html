        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>What do you like to do for fun?

            Everyone has different hobbies and interests, but what about us introverts? Do we have any fun activities that we enjoy doing on our own? Many people might assume that because we are introverted, we don’t have any hobbies or interests. But that couldn’t be further from the truth. In fact, introverts are incredibly diverse individuals with many different likes and interests.</p>

            <h2><u>Publicis Sapient</u></h2>
        <p><li>Publicis Sapient is a global digital transformation consulting company and the digital business transformation independent subsidiary of Publicis Groupe with 20,000 people and over 50 offices worldwide. It was originally established as Sapient in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1990</li></p>
        <h3><u>History</u></h3>
        <p><li>The company Sapient was founded on November 6, 1990 by Jerry Greenberg and J. Stuart Moore in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The company was established as a digital consulting firm and adopted a fixed-term, fixed-price model for IT consulting projects instead of charging on a time and materials basis.
            Sapient embraced internet-based technology early on and by 1999, internet-based work accounted for over 70% of its revenue. From 1992 to 2000, the company saw rapid growth, with revenue increasing from $950,000 to $503 million.
            International expansion
            Following the dot-com bubble burst in the early 2000s, Sapient looked to expand internationally to drive growth. The company implemented a strategy called "Global Distributed Delivery" which leveraged the rapidly growing tech market in India to grow its software development capabilities.
            Throughout its history, Sapient has made several acquisitions, starting with Planning Group International in 2006. Other notable acquisitions include DCG Group in 2008, which enhanced its capital markets offerings, and The Nitro Group in 2009, which added 300 employees</li>
